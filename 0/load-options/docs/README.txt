A 'load-options' will consist of the following files:
  
  preview images     -- Show the user why your load textures are neat.
  apply_load.bat     -- Simple batch file that copies the common.lvl and load.lvl
                        to the game's _lvl_common\load folder. If you are making a new
                        load-options' package just copy the one from the default
                        aspyr folder.
  common.lvl         -- .lvl file conatining the default loading texture.
  load.lvl           -- .lvl file containing the 'load' bubbles and tips border 
                        texture (and a configuration file that tells the game which 
                        background image to use for which map)
