Two options that by default are on are:
1. ai_heroes
2. 'Extra buttons' on the ifs_mp_lobby screen

These are in-game options that are stored in the "0\in-game-options\" folder.
If you don't want one of these to be on, simply move to the '0\in-game-options\disabled' folder.

AI Heroes: Allows an AI to spawn as a hero for each level.
