# Classic Collection Mod Patch
After further time spent with the Classic Collection, it (the game engine) appears too broken to worry about.
Hoping that Aspyr or Lucas Film/Games can get the FB CC into a functional state.

~~Enabling mods to run on the new Classic collection PC game
This is a developing effort to get the  PC Mod Maps from the older version of the games to work with the Classic Collection.~~

~~Releases will be in the 'Releases' portion of this repo.
As of the creation of this repo the game is new and we would expect updates.
With 2005 Star Wars Battlefront II PC, many mods relied on an unofficial patch for much functionality and some base game files were overwritten to accomplish this.~~


### Battlefront 1 modding notes
As of initial release (14 March 2024) the BF1 CC game seems to have switched from Lua 4.0 to using Lua 5.0.2. Unless the go back to Lua 4.0, it means that every BF1 mod will need to be re-done. :(
